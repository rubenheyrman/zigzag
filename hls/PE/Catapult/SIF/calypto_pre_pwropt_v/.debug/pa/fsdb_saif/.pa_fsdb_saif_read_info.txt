     [PA-PSM]     [1.2] Design setup : FSDB/SAIF quality
     [PA-PSM]     ======================================
     [PA-PSM]     
     [PA-PSM]     (Expectation): - The time duration of FSDB/SAIF file should be same between PowerPro and reference tool.
     [PA-PSM]     -              - Activity assertion on primary inputs/outputs, flop outputs, flop clock ports, CGIC outputs,
     [PA-PSM]     -              - memory outputs, memory clock ports should be 100% (value of 80% would classify as ok).
     [PA-PSM]     -              - User signal assertion should be about 80% (value of 60% would classify as ok).
