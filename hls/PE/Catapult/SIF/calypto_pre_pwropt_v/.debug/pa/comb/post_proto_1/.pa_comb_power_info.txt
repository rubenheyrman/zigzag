     [PA-PSM]     
     [PA-PSM]     (Expectation): - Number of combinational cells, area and vectorless leakage power should roughly be same between
     [PA-PSM]     -                PowerPro and SPEF.
     [PA-PSM]     -              - Activity assertion on primary inputs, flop/memory outputs and user nets should be more than 80%.
     [PA-PSM]     -                SPEF should cover major portion of the design (>80%).

     [PA-CNOC]    Total number of combinational cells in PowerPro : 9997
     [PA-CCCA]    Total combinational cells area in PowerPro : 11266.2
     [PA-CCCVL]   Total vectorless combinational leakage power in PowerPro : 259.252 uW
     [PA-PSM]     Total hierarchies in design with correspondence in SPEF  : 0 (0%)
     [PA-PSM]     Total combinational nodes in design covered by SPEF      : 0 (0%)
     [PA-PSM]     
     [PA-PSM]     <WARN> Combinational area more than 30% different between PowerPro and SPEF
     [PA-PSM]     (Suggestion): Check with provider of SPEF whether correct SPEF for design has been given.
     [PA-PSM]     -             Consider using set_scaling command to adjust the sizes of cells being picked by PowerPro.
     [PA-PSM]     
     [PA-PSM]     <WARN> Combinational vectorless leakage power more than 30% different between PowerPro and SPEF
     [PA-PSM]     (Suggestion): To improve leakage power accuracy, check whether different Vth groups need to be created using
     [PA-PSM]     -              set_multi_vth_constraint command.
     [PA-PSM]     
     [PA-PSM]     <WARN> Less than 80% of combinational nodes covered by SPEF 
     [PA-PSM]     (Suggestion): Check with provider of SPEF whether correct SPEF for design has been given.

     [PA-PSM]     Consider using set_scaling command to fix switching, internal and/or leakage power differences.
