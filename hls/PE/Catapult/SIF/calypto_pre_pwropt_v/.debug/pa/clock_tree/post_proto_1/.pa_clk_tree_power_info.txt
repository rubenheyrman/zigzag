     [PA-PSM]     (Expectations):
     [PA-PSM]     - Number of buffers at various levels of clock tree in PowerPro should roughly be same as in SPEF.
     [PA-PSM]     - Total clock tree net cap in PowerPro should roughly be same as in SPEF.

     [PA-PSM]     <WARN> Mismatch in number of clock tree buffers in PowerPro and SPEF.
     [PA-PSM]     (Suggestion): Check with provider of SPEF whether correct SPEF for design has been given.
     [PA-PSM]     -             Use config_clock_tree command to increase/decrease number of buffers at various levels of clock-tree.
     [PA-PSM]     -             Use set_scaling command to fix switching, internal and/or leakage power mismatch.

     [PA-PSM]     <WARN> Mismatch in clock tree net cap in PowerPro and SPEF.
     [PA-PSM]     (Suggestion): Use set_scaling command to match clock tree switching cap between PowerPro and SPEF.
     [PA-PSM]     
     [PA-PSM]     <WARN> Clock tree area more than 30% different between PowerPro and SPEF
     [PA-PSM]     (Suggestion): Check with provider of SPEF whether correct SPEF for design has been given.
     [PA-PSM]     
     [PA-PSM]     <WARN> Clock tree vectorless leakage power more than 30% different between PowerPro and SPEF
     [PA-PSM]     (Suggestion): Check with provider of SPEF whether correct SPEF for design has been given.
