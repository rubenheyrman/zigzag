     [PA-PSM]     [1.3] Design setup : SPEF quality
     [PA-PSM]     =================================
     [PA-PSM]     
     [PA-PSM]     (Expectation): - Cells without name or .lib should ideally be 0% (or a very low number).
     [PA-PSM]     -              - For SPEF to be considered good, almost all the design hierarchies, memories, flops and combinational
     [PA-PSM]     -               nodes should have coverage from SPEF. Coverage means the node belongs to a hierarchy which is also
     [PA-PSM]     -               present in SPEF. At least 80% of design objects should be covered by SPEF.

     [PA-PSM]     <WARN> Low coverage of design hierarchies, flops, combinational nodes
     [PA-PSM]     (Sugestion):  If the coverage of design objects is low, either SPEF is not from the same design or PowerPro has
     [PA-PSM]     -             not been able to match names in SPEF to those in design. Use options -instance_name and
     [PA-PSM]     -             -target_instance of read_spef command to improve coverage. Check whether multiple SPEFs are needed
     [PA-PSM]     -             to cover different sections of the design.
