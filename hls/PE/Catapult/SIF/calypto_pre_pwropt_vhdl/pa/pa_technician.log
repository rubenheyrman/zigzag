[1.1] Design setup : Technology libraries                   
=========================================                   
                   
(Expectation): - Libraries read into PowerPro should be same as that for implementation tool which generated the SPEF.                   
-              - Confirm the correctness of operating-conditions and voltages being used in PowerPro.                   
                   
Library(s) Used          =  "pa/setup/pa_read_lib_info.txt" has complete list of files read into PowerPro.                   
                   
Global Operating Voltage = 1.1                    
Voltage Units = 1V                   
Operating condition      = typical (picked from NangateOpenCellLibrary)                   
                   
Suggestion: Check that operating condition matches with the reference flow. By default, PowerPro uses op-cond from                   
-           first .lib. To change operating condition, either change the order of read_library commands or use                    
-           command set_operating_condition.                   
                   
                   
[1.2] Design setup : FSDB/SAIF quality                   
======================================                   
                   
(Expectation): - The time duration of FSDB/SAIF file should be same between PowerPro and reference tool.                   
-              - Activity assertion on primary inputs/outputs, flop outputs, flop clock ports, CGIC outputs,                   
-              - memory outputs, memory clock ports should be 100% (value of 80% would classify as ok).                   
-              - User signal assertion should be about 80% (value of 60% would classify as ok).

[1.3] Design setup : SPEF quality                   
=================================                   
                   
(Expectation): - Cells without name or .lib should ideally be 0% (or a very low number).                   
-              - For SPEF to be considered good, almost all the design hierarchies, memories, flops and combinational                   
-               nodes should have coverage from SPEF. Coverage means the node belongs to a hierarchy which is also                   
-               present in SPEF. At least 80% of design objects should be covered by SPEF.

<WARN> Low coverage of design hierarchies, flops, combinational nodes                   
(Sugestion):  If the coverage of design objects is low, either SPEF is not from the same design or PowerPro has
