     [PA-PSM]     (Expectations):
     [PA-PSM]     - Number of bit-flops in PowerPro should be roughly same as in SPEF.
     [PA-PSM]     - Activity assertion at flop output/clock ports should be 100%.
     [PA-PSM]     - SPEF should cover large percentage (around 80% or more) design flops.
     [PA-PSM]     - Flop cell profile from PowerPro should roughly match with cell profile in SPEF.
     [PA-PSM]     - Number of CGICs inferred by PowerPro should roughly be same as that in SPEF.

     [PA-PSM]     <WARN> Mismatch in number of flops in PowerPro and SPEF
     [PA-PSM]     (Suggestion): Check with provider of SPEF whether correct SPEF for design has been given.
     [PA-PSM]     
     [PA-PSM]     <WARN> Low coverage of design flops from SPEF
     [PA-PSM]     (Suggestion): Check with provider of SPEF whether correct SPEF for design has been given.

     [PA-PSM]     <WARN> Large mismatch in number of CGICs between PowerPro and SPEF
     [PA-PSM]     (Suggestion): Check whether opt_cg_min_size value in PowerPro matches with implementation tool.

     [PA-PSM]     <WARN> Register area more than 30% different between PowerPro and SPEF
     [PA-PSM]     (Suggestion): Check with provider of SPEF whether correct SPEF for design has been given.
     [PA-PSM]     -             Consider using set_scaling command to adjust the sizes of cells being picked by PowerPro.
     [PA-PSM]     
     [PA-PSM]     <WARN> Register vectorless leakage power more than 30% different between PowerPro and SPEF
     [PA-PSM]     (Suggestion): Check with provider of SPEF whether correct SPEF for design has been given.
