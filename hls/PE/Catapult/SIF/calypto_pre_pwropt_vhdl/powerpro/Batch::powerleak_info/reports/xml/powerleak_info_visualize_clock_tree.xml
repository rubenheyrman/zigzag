Prints information about the CGIC cells present in the design. For each CGIC cell, the report is printed in the following format: ICG-Name, Clock-Source-Name, Depth, RICGE (%), AICGE (%), WICGC, Power Reduction (uW), and N(reg_ICG).

These terms are explained below in more detail.

    1) ICG-Name: Name of the CGIC cell.

    2) Clock-Source-Name: Name of the root clock port.

    3) Depth: Depth of the CGIC cell from the root clock port.

    4) RICGE (%): Relative Integrated Clock Gating Efficiency (in percentage).
       (N(CK) - N(ECK)) / N(CK).

    5) AICGE (%): Absolute Integrated Clock Gating Efficiency (in percentage).
       (N(CK) - N(ECK)) / N(CLK).

    6) WICGC: Weight Integrated Clock Gate Impact On Clock Cycle Reduction.
       (N(CK) - N(ECK)) * N(reg_ICG)

    7) Power Reduction (uW): Power saved by the CGIC cell.

    8) N(reg_ICG)

where,

    N(CK)      : Number of clock cycles at the input clock port of the CGIC cell.
    N(ECK)     : Number of clock cycles at the output clock port of the CGIC cell.
    N(CLK)     : Number of clock cycles at the clock root of the CGIC cell (the clock root is printed in the report).
    N(reg_ICG) : Sum of bit numbers of all the registers driven by the CGIC cell.

NOTE : The information will be printed for only those CGIC cells that have the user SA data available.
